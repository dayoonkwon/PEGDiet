# Diet and Microbiome in PD
This repository hosts the code and methodology used for filtering high-resolution sequencing data, conducting statistical analyses, and generating figures as presented in our research paper, published in npj Parkinson's Disease, 2024.

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to provide transparency and reproducibility for the computational analyses carried out in our study. We encourage other researchers to review, reuse, and build upon the work presented here.


## Contents
- Data Filtering: Code used for preprocessing raw sequencing data.
- Statistical Analysis: R code for performing the statistical tests and models reported.
- Figure: Code to reproduce the figures and visualizations from our results.
